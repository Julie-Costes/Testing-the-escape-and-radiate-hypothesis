# Testing-the-escape-and-radiate-hypothesis

# template_script: Set of scripts used during my M2 internship to implement the approach for testing the escape-and-radiate hypothesis (Nymphalini example).

# fig: Overview of the approach followed to test the escape-and-radiate hypothesis. The speciation rates of herbivorous insects are estimated using the BDD method (Birth-Death Diffusion; left panel), and their interactions with host plants are reconstructed using the ELEFANT method (Evolution of LatEnt traits For Ancestral Network reconsTruction; right panel), in order to test the potential link between the two.
